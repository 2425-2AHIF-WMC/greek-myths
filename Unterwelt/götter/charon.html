        <h2>Who is Charon?</h2>
        <p>
            Charon is a figure from ancient Greek mythology, known as the ferryman of the underworld. He is tasked with transporting the souls of the dead across the rivers that divide the world of the living from the world of the dead, most notably the river Acheron. In some versions of the myth, the river Styx is mentioned instead. Charon is the son of Erebus (Darkness) and Nyx (Night), two primordial deities. His role is essential in the passage to the afterlife, and he appears in many ancient sources, including Homer’s epics and later Roman adaptations.

        <h2>Role in the Afterlife</h2>
        <p>
            In the beliefs of the ancient Greeks, a proper burial was essential for a soul’s peaceful transition to the afterlife. One of the most important rituals was placing a coin, usually an obol or a danake, in or on the body of the deceased—often in the mouth or on the eyes. This coin served as payment for Charon's services. Without it, a soul would be refused passage and would be doomed to wander the shores of the underworld for eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Charon does not pass judgment on the dead. His role is purely that of a transporter, taking souls from the realm of the living into the realm of the dead. Those judged by the gods or other underworld figures such as Minos or Rhadamanthus would then continue deeper into the underworld, into places like the Elysian Fields or Tartarus, depending on the nature of their lives.

        <h2>Appearance and Depictions</h2>
        <p>
            Charon is usually depicted as an elderly, grim figure with sunken eyes, a rough beard, and dark robes. He is almost always shown holding a long pole, which he uses to push his boat across the dark waters of the underworld. In classical art, especially on funerary vases and tomb reliefs, Charon is often shown standing in his boat, sometimes receiving a soul from Hermes, who acted as the guide of the dead (psychopomp).
        </p>
        <p>
            In some medieval depictions influenced by Christian imagery, Charon is rendered more grotesquely or demonically, emphasizing the fearsome nature of death. Later Renaissance and Romantic interpretations sometimes softened or dramatized his appearance for artistic effect.

        <h2>Symbolic Meaning</h2>
        <p>
            Charon is not simply a figure from mythology, but also a powerful symbol. He represents the inevitability of death and the necessity of transition. In many ways, he embodies the threshold between life and the unknown. His neutrality—he does not judge or choose, but merely transports—emphasizes that all mortals, regardless of their status in life, must eventually face death.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ritual of paying Charon also reflects the ancient Greeks’ belief in duty and preparation for the afterlife. Failing to properly honor the dead could have dire consequences for their souls. This makes Charon not only a mythical character but also a ritual reminder of the importance of honoring life and death.

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>
            Charon has appeared in countless works of literature, art, and popular culture throughout the centuries. He is featured in Virgil’s "Aeneid," where Aeneas meets him during his descent into the underworld. Dante includes Charon in the "Inferno," where he ferries souls across the river Acheron into Hell. These later adaptations often enhance Charon’s sinister qualities, sometimes portraying him as a malevolent figure.
        </p>
        <p>
            In modern times, Charon appears in films, video games, comic books, and novels. Whether as a dark boatman, a grim Reaper-like figure, or a more complex psychological symbol, Charon endures as a powerful reminder of mortality. Even Pluto's largest moon is named "Charon," emphasizing his importance and his role as a companion to the distant and cold reaches of myth and space alike.
