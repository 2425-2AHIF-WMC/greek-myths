        <h2>Persephone – The Queen of the Underworld</h2>
        <p>One of the most famous myths surrounding Hades is his marriage to Persephone, daughter of Demeter. According to legend, Hades abducted Persephone and took her to the Underworld. After negotiations, Zeus decreed that she would spend one-third of the year in the Underworld and the rest with her mother. This cycle is said to be the origin of the seasons.</p>
