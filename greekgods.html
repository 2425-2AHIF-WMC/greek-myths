            The ancient greeks had a polytheistic religion, where every god and goddess had certain areas they were responsible for. Therefore, it was very important to whom you prayed for what occasion. The most important of the gods were the 12 Olympians, which were more powerful than any other gods.         </p>

            <h2>Hestia</h2>
            <p>Hestia was the first child of the titan Kronos, who ruled the world before the gods. Kronos was a tyrant and scared to lose his position, so he swallowed her whole. She stayed in his stomach until Zeus freed her and her siblings. Hestia is the goddess of the hearth and the home. She doesn’t really have temples as she was worshipped in every home. She used to be an Olympian until she gave up her throne for Dionysus.</p>

            <p>Hades is the oldest son of Kronos, although often mistaken as the youngest. He is the god of the underworlds and the dead.

Poseidon and her have gotten in a few fights and their relationship is strained.</p>

            <h2>Apollo & Artemis</h2>
            <p>Artemis and Apollo are twin gods born to a titan and Zeus, which enraged Hera, and she forbade any land to let their mother give birth. In the end she found refuge on a floating island. Artemis is the goddess of the hunt, wilderness, childbirth, chastity and the moon. She also has a group of nymphs, that swore off men, following her. Apollo is the god of poetry, music, healing, archery, diseases, the sun, prophecy and more. </p>

        <div class="card-text">
            <h2>Dionysus</h2>
            <p>Dionysus isn’t special because he was born to Zeus and a human, but because his mother died before he was born Zeus stitched him into his thigh and gave birth to him that way. Unsure of his godhood Dionysus travelled the world until he found his way to Olympus where Hestia gave up her seat for him which is why there’s 5 goddesses and 7 gods, and he sits on the goddesses’ side. He is the god of wine, festivity, ecstasy and madness and is known to be very feminine.</p>

            <p>Persephone is Demeter and Zeus‘ daughter and goddess of spring. When Hades kidnapped her to be his wife in the underworld Demeter did not let anything grow until Persephone was returned. However, because she had eaten pomegranate seeds in the underworld, she could not return. In the end she spends half her time above ground and half below, which is why summer and winter exist because Demeter doesn’t let anything grow when she is gone.</p>
